## Callback Functions

Callback functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, enabling asynchronous programming and allowing functions to be passed as arguments to other functions for execution at a later time.

## What is a Callback Function?

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

## Basic Syntax

```js filename="callback-basic.js" copy
function outerFunction(callback) {
  // Code before executing callback
  callback();
  // Code after executing callback
}
```

## Synchronous Callbacks
Synchronous callbacks are executed immediately, such as with array methods like forEach, map, and filter.

### Example with forEach
```js filename="callback-basic.js" copy
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(number => {
  console.log(number);
});
```

Explanation

In this example, the callback function is executed synchronously for each element in the numbers array.
