# Removing Duplicates in JavaScript: From Arrays to Strings
Removing duplicates is a common problem in programming that can arise in various contexts, such as cleaning up data or ensuring unique entries. You might be asked this question during an interview, as itâ€™s quite simple and can warm you up for more difficult questions. However, while it may seem basic, the nuances of different methods can reveal a lot about your understanding of JavaScript.

In this article, we will explore three methods in JavaScript for removing duplicates: the iterative approach, using the Set object, and utilizing the filter method. We'll cover both arrays and strings because, let's face it, if you can't handle duplicates, should you even be programming?

## Removing Duplicates from Arrays
### Iterative Approach
The iterative approach uses a simple for loop to check each element and add it to a new array if it hasn't been added before. It's a straightforward method but can be less efficient for large datasets.
