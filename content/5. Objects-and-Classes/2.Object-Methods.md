# Object Methods

In JavaScript, objects can have properties that are functions. These properties are called methods. Methods allow objects to encapsulate behavior and perform actions using their own data. This section will guide you through the basics of creating and using object methods, with practical examples and best practices.

## Creating Methods

### Method Syntax

You can define methods inside an object literal using the function keyword or the shorthand method syntax.

```js [method-syntax.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John."
```

### Shorthand Method Syntax
```js [shorthand-syntax.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John."
```

## Using `this`{lang=ts} in Methods
Context of `this`{lang=ts}
The value of `this`{lang=ts} inside a method refers to the object that called the method.

```js [this.js] copy
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

const anotherPerson = {
  name: "Jane",
  greet: person.greet
};

person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is John."
anotherPerson.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Jane."
```

<div class='explanation'>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><code>this</code></strong> inside a method refers to the object that called the method. This allows methods to access and manipulate the object's properties.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
