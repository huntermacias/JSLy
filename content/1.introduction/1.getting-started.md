# Getting Started with JavaScript

Welcome to your journey of mastering JavaScript! This guide will help you get started with the basics and point you towards resources for more advanced topics.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language that's essential for web development. Whether you're building interactive websites, server-side applications, or mobile apps, JavaScript is the tool you need.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To begin writing JavaScript, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

### 1. Install a Code Editor

A good code editor makes coding easier. Here are some popular options:

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: A free, open-source editor with powerful features.
- **[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)**: A fast, flexible editor with a rich ecosystem.
- **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**: A hackable editor built by GitHub.

### 2. Set Up Node.js

Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server and use its package manager (npm) to install libraries and tools.

1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

3. Create Your First JavaScript File
4. Open your code editor and create a new file named app.js.
5. Write your first JavaScript code:

```js [app.js] copy
console.log('Hello, JavaScript!');
```

6. Run your JavaScript file using Node.js:

```bash
node app.js
```

You should see Hello, JavaScript! printed in your terminal.
